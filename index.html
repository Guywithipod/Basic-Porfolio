                            Hi! My name is Anthony and I'm a saint paul local, I've lived most of my life with a short
                            break
                            of 5 years spent in North Dakota. There I obtained my B.S. in chemical engineering at the
                            University of North Dakota and worked for Halliburton for a little under a year. Due to the
                            nature of Chemical engineering, most of the jobs available are factory 12 hour shifts during
                            the
                            night. I didn't move back just to have the same life style, I came back to be with family
                            and
                            friends! So after much debate I've decided that the next step was a coding boot camp course
                            at
                            the U of M. I'm super excited and cannot wait to begin the next chapter of my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A little about me on a more personal level. I don't really let stress or anger et the better
                            of
                            me. I'm very laid back and agreeable. I'm a people persona and I enjoy meeting new people
                            and
                            having them share thier stories with me! Its no surprise I work well in groups, my best work
                            happens when I am able to bounce ideas off people. I also love helping people grow thier
                            skills
                            and abilities. I once had a mentor tell me I shouldn't be training people for thier current
                            job,
                            I should be preparing them for thier next job.
                        </p>
